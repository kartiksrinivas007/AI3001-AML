The objective is to minimize the regret function in the net timestpes $T$

\begin{equation}
    \label{Regret}
    R_T  = \sum_T l(y_t, a_t)  - \min_{a \in A} \sum_T l(y_t, a)
\end{equation}

The loss in \ref{Regret} is like loss in hindisght.
The sum term that is $\sum_T l(y_t, a_t)$ is a good cumulative loss but it is hard to compare two algorithms, 
The adversary can simply always beat you everywhere. However he cannot do this with the Regret loss function, because his choice
of actions even though that maximizes the first may actually start to maximize the second term also.

\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{OF Framework}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \For{$t = 1 \to T$}
            % \State $a_t \gets \argmin_{a \in A} \sum_{i=1}^{t-1} l(y_i, a)$
            \State Algorithm $A$ chooses $a_t \in A$
            \State $y_t \gets f(a_t)$
            \State $l_t \gets l(y_t, a_t) \ \ l \in \mathcal{L}$ \Comment{I must do well on every single $l$}
        \EndFor
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


The interpretation is that the environment is not being modelled, it is completely adversarial in its nature
and the objective is to minimize the regret

\textcolor{red}{It is unclear why the actions dont change in the RHT of the regret function.}
Applications may include weather filetring, spam filtering and stoick prediction.
In spam filtering the objective function

In stock prediction, the reward can be considered to be some $r_t$ (decided by the adversary) and the weight vector is that of the distribution of money in the stocks
The loss will be negative of the sum of inner products.

\begin{equation}
    \label{stock}
    l = - \sum_t \langle p_t ,r_t \rangle
\end{equation}

        \For{$t = 1 \to T$}
            % \State $a_t \gets \argmin_{a \in A} \sum_{i=1}^{t-1} l(y_i, a)$
            \State Create expert predictions $D$
            \State Algorithm $A$ chooses $p_t \in D$
            \State Adversary chooses $y_t$ and $l_t$
            \State $l_t \gets l(y_t, a_t) \ \ l \in \mathcal{L}$ \Comment{I must do well on every single $l$}

Say that the problem is Binary outputm i.e the $p_t$ and $y_t$ are both binary output (space $\mathcal{Y} = {0,1}$)
There is exactly

            \State Create expert predictions $D$
            \State Algorithm $A$ chooses The Majority $p_t \in D$
            \State Adversary chooses $y_t$ and $l_t$
            \If{$l_t(p_t, y_t) = 1$ }
                \State Throw out the majority
            \Else
                \State Keep the majority, no loss incurred
            \EndIf
